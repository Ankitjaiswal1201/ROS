Monitoring light using Arduino and ROS



We can start coding a basic Arduino-ROS node that can sense the amount of light using a 
light-dependent resistor (LDR). You can use any Arduino for this demo; 
The characteristic of an LDR is that it is basically a resistor in which the
resistance across it changes when light falls on it. The maximum resistance is when there is
no light and minimum when light falls on it.

We have to connect one pin to 5V from the Arduino board and the next terminal to the
Arduino's A0 pin. That terminal is connected to the GND pin through a 10 KÎ© resistor. It is
basically a voltage divider circuit. The equation for finding the voltage at A0 is as follows:
V_a0 = 5 * (R2 / (R1 + R2))
From the equation, it is clear that when there is no light, we will get the minimum voltage,
and when there is light, we'll get the maximum. This value can be read out using an
Arduino program.
